These are files containing the Fortran examples for the book:

Guide to Numerical Algorithm Design and Development:
Including Legacy Examples from Fortran and MathCAD in High Precision

Each example is in a compressed format "*.tar.gz" created on a linux system
and each has its own README file on how to compile and run the example
on your own platform.

Changes may be necessary for the compile, Makefile, and run scripts.

After download follow these steps on your own platform for each example.

1. create a directory with the example name
2. copy the file to that directory
3. explore the contents of the file
4. unzip the file
5. untar the file

As an example for KERRIGEN these are the steps

1. mkdir KERRIGEN
2. cp kerrigen.tar.gz KERRIGEN
3. cd KERRIGEN
4. tar -tzvf kerrigen.tar.gz
5. gunzip kerrigen.tar.gz
6. tar -xvf kerrigen.tar
